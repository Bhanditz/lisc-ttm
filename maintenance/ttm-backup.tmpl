# Here's one way to do backups on the production server:
#
# Create a user named 'ttmbackup', whose has no password, whose shell
# is set to /bin/bash, and whose home directory is readable only by
# that user & group.
#
# Create also a MySQL user named 'ttmro' (for "TTM read-only"), with
# read access to all of the TTM databases and MySQL procecdures:
#
#   GRANT USAGE ON *.*                                \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT ON `mysql`.`proc`                    \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON `ttm-core`.*         \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON `ttm-trp`.*          \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON `ttm-swop`.*         \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON `ttm-lsna`.*         \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON `ttm-enlace`.*       \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#   GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON `ttm-bickerdike`.*   \
#         TO ttmro@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWD';
#
# (PASSWD should be the same for all of them.)
#
# Then run ./make-backup-script, for example like this:
#
#   $ ./make-backup-script
#   Top destination directory for backups: /home/ttmbackup/backups
#   DB user with read-only access to TTM databases: ttmro
#   Password for DB user: (same PASSWD from above)
#
#   Backup script created: 'backup-ttm'
#
#   $ 
#
# Now you have a 'backup-ttm' script that you can run as in a cron job
# as user 'ttmbackup', assuming you set up permissions appropriately.
# For example, you could put this in /etc/crontab
#
#   30 3 * * * ttmbackup /usr/local/bin/backup-ttm
#
# ...to have the script run at 3:30am every morning and put the backup
# in /home/ttmbackup/backups/ttm-prod-backup-DATE_TIME.tar.gz.  (Of
# course, you might want to have another cron job that then copies the
# backup to an off-site location.)
