"Testing The Model" (TTM)
======================

TTM is an open source web application for managing data collected by
community organizations.

Background
----------

"Testing The Model" (TTM) is a collaboration between five neighborhood
organizations in Chicago and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation
([lisc-chicago.org](http://lisc-chicago.org)).

Since 2012, the organizations have been working on local issues using
a data-informed approach that is designed to test the effectiveness of
focusing multiple community-based partners around tightly-defined
interventions.  The TTM code implements a database-backed web site
where the organizations enter collected data and generate reports.
This software was originally developed and deployed by [Chapin
Hall](http://chapinhall.org/) at the University of Chicago, starting
in early 2013, and in mid-2014 [Open Tech
Strategies](http://opentechstrategies.com/) assumed maintenance.
