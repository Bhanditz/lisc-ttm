"Test The Model" (TTM)
======================

TTM (“Test The Model”) is a collaboration between five neighborhood
organizations in Chicago and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation
(LISC.org).  Since in 2012, the organizations have been working on
local issues using a data-informed approach designed to test the model
of focusing multiple community-based partners around tightly-defined
interventions.  The code here is for the web site and database where
the organizations enter collected data and generate reports.  The TTM
code is open source software licensed under the **TBD** license.  See
the file LICENSE.md for details.
