# Little Village Youth Safety Network Database: User Guide for Community Partners


### Access, logging in, and user privileges
- The Little Village Youth Safety Network database (still called Testing the Model Data Center on the actual site) can be accessed using, ideally, Firefox or Google Chrome.  
- The URL for accessing the system is http://ttm.lisc-chicago.org. 


### Quick start steps for new users:

1. Get your login information from your local administrator.
2. Change your password to something secure but that you will remember. Repeating your username, using “password,” or using any single word makes your youth data vulnerable. 
3. Add participants. Go to your program page (Click on “Programs” at the top of the page and then your program). At the bottom of the list of participants, you should see a link for “Add a participant.” Click on that link. Enter the youth’s name (make sure not to have any spaces after the name), (optionally) date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format, and click search. 
   - If her/his name appears in the first drop-down menu, click on the name. Then, click on the next drop-down menu to choose the session, and click “add participant.” 
   - If her/his name does not appear in the first drop-down menu, you will need to add her/him to the database. Click on the following drop-down menu to select the appropriate session, fill in the information in the box below (again, date of birth should be in YYYY-MM-DD format), and click on “save.” 
4. Check to see if they need an intake added. Click on a participant’s name to go to her/his page. Near the bottom of the box on the left side of the page, you will see a list of intake and impact surveys. 
   - If they have an intake (pre survey) within the last few months, they are probably enrolled in another program, so do not do an intake with them. Contact the other organization to coordinate who does the surveys (so youth aren’t being bombarded with surveys). 
   - If they have an impact survey within the last 6 months, that survey will be copied for their pre survey, so do not do an intake with them. 
   - If they do not have any surveys or if their last impact survey is over 6 months old, do an intake with them. 
5. Enter intakes. After completing the intakes with the youth who need them on paper, click on “Add new intake survey” and fill out the questions. 
6. Enter attendance. Under each session, click on “add date” to add the dates your program runs. Uncheck anyone who was absent. 
7. As each session ends, get ready for impact assessments and program quality surveys. The impact assessment measures change in some of the areas found in the intake; you administer and enter it. Enlace or someone in your organization but not part of your program administers the program quality surveys, which Enlace then enters. Both should be done in the last couple of weeks of programming. 


If you have trouble with the database, discover a glitch, or have any questions, please contact your local administrator, who will be happy to help! 


## In-depth Guide


### Participants

- Generally speaking, you will access participant profiles from your program page, either by adding existing participants to your program, or by creating a profile for new youth. 
- Once on a participant’s page, please enter/update as much information (address, grade, etc.) as you can in the box at the left side of the screen. 
- At the bottom of that box is the space for entering intake and impact surveys. 
   - If they have an intake (pre survey) within the last few months, they are probably enrolled in another program, so do not do an intake with them. Contact the other organization to coordinate who does the surveys (so youth aren’t being bombarded with surveys). 
   - If they have an impact survey within the last 6 months, that survey will be copied for their pre survey, so do not do an intake with them. 
   - If they do not have any surveys or if their last impact survey is over 6 months old, do an intake with them. It’s generally a good idea to complete this on paper, then enter it into the database. 
   - A few weeks before the end of programming (if they are not enrolled in another program simultaneously), enter their impact survey. 
- You can see at the top of the page if they are involved with any other programs. This can be useful if you want to coordinate services for that youth. There is also a link back to your program’s page. 
- Mentorship hours (if applicable) are entered on the Participant Profile. At the bottom of the Mentorship Hours section, enter the date (using the pop-up calendar or YYYY-MM-DD format), the number of hours, and which session they hours should count towards. They will be included in totals and subtotals that are displayed on relevant Program Profiles.
- Certain items on the Participant Profile are only relevant for youth, including intake assessments, program impact surveys, and consent form tracking. These will only appear if the participant role field is set to “youth/student”. 


### Institutions

- The Institution Profile lists basic contact information for the institution, as well as any campaigns or programs that are associated with the institution in the database.
- You generally won’t need to use this tab. 


### Programs

- The Program Profile contains information about the program’s schedule, total enrollment for each session, attendance, surveys that have been completed about that program, and (if mentorship has been selected as one of the activities associated with that program), mentorship hours.
- Each program in the system must be associated with one or more sessions. This allows the system to keep track of enrollment and attendance over time, using the start and end dates associated with each session. One session is included when you create a new program. To add more sessions, use the “Add new session” fields at the top of the page. If you need to rename a session, use the “Edit session name” fields. Please note that dates for sessions cannot be changed, so it is a good idea to have the start date earlier and the end date later than you will need them. Example: A program running from mid-June to mid-August could have its session dates be June 1 to August 31. 
- On the left side of the screen, fill out the information about your program (type of activities, days and hours of operation, etc.). 
- Adding participants: At the bottom of the participants list, there is a link for “Add new participant.” Search for her/him, and be sure not to leave a space after a person’s name; the system treats a space as part of their name. You can also include their date of birth, especially if searching for a common name. If the youth has a profile in the system, select the participant’s profile from the drop-down menu, select a session from that drop-down menu, and add the participant. 
- After you search, if the person is not listed in the database, a box will appear where you can add them. Please enter as much information as you can about the youth, in this box and on their profile page. 
- Entering attendance: At the bottom of the page is the “Program Dates” section. Select the date (from the pop-up calendar or enter it using YYYY-MM-DD format), select the session from the drop-down menu, and click “submit.” You can do this several times over before marking youth present/absent. By default, all participants are marked present. Click on the session name to see all dates in that session, and uncheck the boxes for any participant who was absent (you do not need to click save or submit; it updates automatically). 
- Program Quality Survey: Enlace or someone in your organization but not your program administers these. Contact your administrator few weeks before each session ends to coordinate administration. These are fine in a group setting. 
- The “Participants” subsection of the Program Profile tracks dosage percentage and total number of hours of programming for the participants enrolled in the program. The “total hours” calculations are based on the days per week and daily start and end time for the program. Please ensure that this information has been entered for the program if the total hours do not appear to be calculating correctly. 
- If you make a mistake in adding a program or session, they can be deleted. Contact the Data Specialist for help with this.  


Campaigns and Events are not really used. Feel free to play around with them if they might be useful for you, but there are no requirements related to them. 


### Reports and exports

- The system features three built-in reporting tools, as well as the ability to export data in the system for custom reporting and analysis.
- The Program Enrollment report shows the total enrollment and number of dropped participants. 
- The Assessments report shows the aggregated responses for the questions on the intake assessment and program impact survey. This report can be filtered by question, or just looked at as a whole. The first three sections are helpful in demonstrating the need for services amongst the youth you serve. The last three sections are useful in seeing how the youth change as they progress through your program (by comparing pre- and post-test percentages). 
- The Program Quality report shows the aggregated responses for the questions on the program quality survey. This report can also be filtered by question. It is helpful for seeing how youth feel about your program. 
- The Export option provides download links for comma separated value (.csv) files of all the the data in the system for your program. Where applicable, a link for a de-identified version of the file is provided as well, for sharing with partners or evaluators without including identifying personal information about participants. 
- You can only access information from your own program. If you are interested in aggregate data from all LVYSN programs, contact your administrator. They would also be happy to discuss ways you can use the reports for internal evaluation, grant writing, and other uses.
